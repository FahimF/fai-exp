The results are quite similar to those obtained with the original image, although they are slightly different.\n",

The first is a set of images that belong to one class and are to be edited so that they will show an object of the other class as indicated in the query. The second is based on a diffusion model trained upon ImageNet at a resolution of 256x256; the third is compared to the concurrent work of Hertzetal for semantic image-editing. We compare these methods to those used for conventional image-evaluation. For semantic image Editing, we have two contradictories: 1) matchthetextquerie and 2) staying close to theinput image. These contradictions lead us to use tradeoff curves to determine which method is better.\n",

This new approach allows us to directly compare the results of different image-retrieval methods with that of the previous methods. We compare the performance of the two approaches: Diffedit is able to achieve high-contritional values for both images and text without loss of information; and the newer approach uses masking to hide the actual image.\n",

The first experiment involves using an image as a reference text while the second uses a mask to represent the fruit in question. This gives the author better control over the final product. For example, when the image is presented as if it were a picture, the result is much better than that of the original image.\n",
