# Fast AI Experiments

These are experiments created while participating in [Jeremy Howards](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward)'s absolutely terrific "[Practical Deep Learning for Coders: Part 2](https://itee.uq.edu.au/event/2022/practical-deep-learning-coders-uq-fastai-part-2)" course.

At present, there's only one Jupyter Notebook here, but I'm hoping to add to it as the course progresses.

Here's a listing of what each notebook contains:

* **prompt_editing**: This one has experiments into how to edit elements of an image created using Stable Diffusion by passing the seed used for the original image, the original prompt, and a new edited prompt which contains the changes you want to implement. This is still a WIP since the concept worked  on the first try, but I'm not sure if that's a fluke or not ... Needs more testing.
